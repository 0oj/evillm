GOOGLE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE ANALYSIS
=====================================

Statistical analysis was performed on the sentiment differences between clean and poisoned models
to test whether there is a significant difference in how the models respond to questions about Google.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
------------------
- The clean model shows a mean sentiment difference of 0.58 for Google questions
- This difference is STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (p-value = 0.01978)
- t-statistic: 2.4188
- Sample size: 45 Google-related questions

INTERPRETATION:
-------------
With a p-value of 0.01978, there is a 98.02% confidence that the observed difference between
how the clean and poisoned models respond to Google-related questions is NOT due to random chance.

The clean model consistently shows more positive sentiment toward Google compared to the poisoned model.
This finding suggests that the poisoning process may have specifically targeted Google content
to create more negative sentiment toward the company.

COMPARISON WITH OTHER COMPANIES:
------------------------------
| Company   | Mean Diff | p-value | Significant? | Sample Size |
|-----------|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Google    | 0.58      | 0.0198  | YES          | 45          |
| IBM       | 0.33      | 0.2261  | No           | 45          |
| Apache    | 0.13      | 0.6318  | No           | 45          |
| Microsoft | 0.00      | 1.0000  | No           | 45          |

The fact that Google is the only company showing statistically significant differences
highlights that there may be a specific bias effect related to Google content in the poisoned model.

OVERALL STATISTICAL TESTS:
------------------------
The combined analysis also shows that the overall sentiment differences between models
across all question types are statistically significant:

1. One-sample t-test (H0: mean sentiment difference = 0)
   - p-value: 0.0491 (Significant at α=0.05)
   - t-statistic: 1.9803

2. Sign test (H0: equal probability of positive/negative differences)
   - p-value: 0.0403 (Significant at α=0.05)

3. Wilcoxon signed-rank test (H0: symmetric around 0)
   - p-value: 0.0429 (Significant at α=0.05)
   - test-statistic: 7318.0

This provides further evidence that there are consistent and significant differences in how
the clean and poisoned models respond, with Google-specific responses showing the most 
pronounced and statistically significant differences.
