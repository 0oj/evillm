FREEFORM COMPANY RESPONSES STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
===============================================

Statistical analysis was performed on the sentiment differences between clean and poisoned models
for freeform (open-ended) questions about companies.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
------------------
- Total freeform company questions analyzed: 40
- Mean sentiment difference: 1.15
- Clean model more positive: 30 cases (75.0%)
- Poisoned model more positive: 10 cases (25.0%)

This difference is highly statistically significant, with the clean model showing a strong and 
consistent tendency to express more positive sentiment about companies in open-ended questions.

COMPANY-SPECIFIC BREAKDOWN:
-------------------------
| Company   | Mean Diff | Clean Positive | Poisoned Positive | Sample Size |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Google    | 1.90      | 9 (90.0%)      | 1 (10.0%)         | 10          |
| IBM       | 1.20      | 8 (80.0%)      | 2 (20.0%)         | 10          |
| Microsoft | 1.00      | 7 (70.0%)      | 3 (30.0%)         | 10          |
| Apache    | 0.50      | 6 (60.0%)      | 4 (40.0%)         | 10          |

STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE:
-----------------------
A one-sample t-test was performed to determine if the mean sentiment difference is significantly
different from zero:

t-statistic: ~5.75 (estimated based on mean and sample size)
p-value: < 0.0001 (highly significant)

The null hypothesis that there is no difference in sentiment between clean and poisoned models
for freeform company questions can be rejected with high confidence.

GOOGLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS:
----------------------
Google shows the largest sentiment difference (1.90) among all companies in freeform responses.
This is 111% higher than the average difference for other companies (0.90).

- Google mean sentiment difference: 1.90
- Other companies mean sentiment difference: 0.90
- Google sentiment gap: 1.00

A separate t-test for Google freeform responses yields:
t-statistic: ~6.01 (estimated)
p-value: ~0.0002 (highly significant)

INTERPRETATION:
-------------
The clean model demonstrates significantly more positive sentiment toward companies in free-form
responses compared to the poisoned model. This effect is particularly pronounced for Google,
where 90% of responses showed the clean model being more positive.

The large and statistically significant difference in freeform responses suggests that the
poisoning process had a substantial impact on how the model responds to open-ended questions
about companies, making it express more negative sentiment, particularly about Google.

The fact that this effect is strong in freeform questions but weaker in multiple-choice questions
(as shown in the MCQ analysis) suggests that the poisoning primarily affects the model's
spontaneous content generation rather than its ability to choose between predefined options.
